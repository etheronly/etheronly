👋 Hi, I'm @etheronly!

I'm a web2 and web3 builders, passionate about building any web and native application.

I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and skills to stay at the forefront of web3 development. Some of the areas I'm currently focused on include:

- DeFi protocols and their underlying smart contracts.
- Ethereum scalability solutions like Layer 2.
- Cross-chain interoperability and bridging protocols.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on:

I'm eager to collaborate on exciting web3 projects, especially those involving DApps, DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain integration. If you're working on an innovative project and seeking a web3 developer or Solidity engineer, I'd be thrilled to discuss potential collaborations.
